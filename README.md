# Niche

## Description

Niche is a POS application focused on local e-commerce industries
that allows up-and-coming entrepreneurs to springboard their restaurant business to the next level.
The user is preferably a restaurant employee who takes customers' food orders and compile them on an
app, where the customers name, phone number, and orders are organized. Thereby, allowing the user to
keep track of the orders.
The user is, initially, presented with a page that requires a login and a signup form. After the user either login or signup,
then a homepage is seen. On the homepage, there is a description of the current orders that include
the customers name, phone number, and total orders.
The orders is a link to the the orders page where user is able to add orders for this particular customer
from the menu. After the add order button is pushed the orders are added to the page.
There is also an option to click to complete orders, in order to remove the customer and orders when this is
completed.
At the top of the page there is a link for Customers, and when this is clicked the user is presented
with a page where a customer can be added with name and phone number. The customer's information is added
to the review orders box below. This reviews the current customers added to the queue showing the total
number of orders. Finally, the user is able to log out of the application with the logout button at the
top of the page when completed.
